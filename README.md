- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

Iâ€™m Sagar Mahata, an independent game developer focused on creating original and engaging gameplay experiences. Iâ€™m currently developing two unique projects:

MirrorDice â€“ A digital board game with mirrored movement mechanics, strategic obstacles, and multiple gameplay modes.

Hook Dash â€“ A fast-paced action game built around momentum, timing, and precision.

My goal is to build fun, polished games that stand out through creative mechanics and thoughtful design. Thank you for your time and support.

Best,
Sagar Mahata

Also, i need a computer to start working on my ideas, I've a clear roadmap ahead, your help needed -
